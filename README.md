# Frontend Mentor | QR Code Component

A challenge recommended by Frontend Mentor to develop primarily using HTML and CSS.

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my take on this project out! I hope to learn more and grow as a developer, so I'm taking on Frontend Mentor's challenges.

It was a bit nerve-wracking at first and I felt I truly panicked, like being thrust into an exam after weeks of unexcused absences, but I think I landed on my feet just fine!

Thanks for reading!
